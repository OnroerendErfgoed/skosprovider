  Skosprovider provides an interface that can be
  included in an application to allow it to talk to
  different SKOS vocabularies. These vocabularies
  could be defined locally or accessed remotely
  through webservices.

  Adhering to this interface in you application
  decouples your application and the actual
  thesaurus. This makes unit testing easy because it
  allows you to swap a remote and a local
  implementation. It also makes it easy to switch
  from a simple, static implementation based on a csv
  file to a more complete implementation using your
  relational database of choice.

  One of the main goals of this project is to be able
  to build an application that can use thesauri or
  vocabularies without knowing upfront what these
  might be or where they might come from. This could
  be for an application that allows cataloguing
  things, but where it can be expected that different
  instances will require different thesauri or would
  need to be able to talk to existing vocabulary
  systems.
